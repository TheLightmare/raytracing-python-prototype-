# raytracing-python-prototype-
this is a prototype of raytracing with python and pygame module. The code is dirty, so i'm working currently on a remake.

 the file 'raytracing.py' is the most advanced raytracer (but not actually readable), and the file 'raytracing_3.py' is an unfinished remake (readable and usable).
 
 The current features in 'raytracing.py' are :
 - sphere
 - plane
 - shadows on sphere and plane
 - mirror sphere
 BUT :
 - we can't change the scene (it is hardcoded right into the formulas)
 
 The features of 'raytracing_3.py' :
 - sphere
 - plane
 - shadows on sphere and plane (glitched on sphere, so this is a beta feature ;) )
 - we can change the scene and add as much planes and spheres as we want (and customize colors)
 UPDATES INCOMING (not in any order):
 - mirror spheres
 - fix shadows
 - glass sphere (with refraction)
 - colored light sources
